## 2. Application Coding
	
- [ ] The app must store, collect, and search data sets collected from pre-existing .csv files (or
	equivalent) - example: Northwind’s ‘orders’ and ‘order detail’ files.  The external file is

	should track name, position, SSN, home address, email, phone numbers, skills and have a
	unique identifier. 
	
- [ ] Fields such as SSN, email, orders numbers, product ID numbers, and phone numbers
	must be in a PROPER format 
	
- [ ] Application to be packaged and transmitted as a “.exe” using ‘pyinstaller’

	sharing, and other appropriate language (eg.. “user may not sell or distribute data without
	the express consent of Forestview....”) 
	
- [ ] Important: you must also provide a unilateral indemnity clause, precluding Forestview
	from legal ramifications for things such as data breaches, zero-day attacks, and database
	worms, such as SQL injection. 
	
- [ ] Include language indicating periodic vulnerability assessments against your system, and
	that you also demand said preventive actions from all your key vendors
